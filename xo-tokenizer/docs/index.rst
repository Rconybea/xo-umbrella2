Xo-tokenizer documentation
==========================

xo-tokenizer provides a tokenizer for the Schematika language.

Syntax is generally C-like, but with some important differences.
Notably, characters used for arithmetic operators (``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``)
may appear in variable names:  ``one-of-those-days`` is an ordinary symbol.
